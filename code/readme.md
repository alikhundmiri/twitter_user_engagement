## Idea

Enter the user name, and this algorithm will fetch their most recent tweets and replies, and evaluate if the user is "active" on twitter, i.e. interacting and talking to other people. 

And not only posting random stuff to drive traffic to their website/page.

## How to:

* Fetch user's most recent tweets
	* Twitter API.
	* done?
* Fetch user's Most recent replies and mentions.



## How to monetise?
The current idea for monetising, is to allow a new paid version of service (duh) where user can evaluate all the people they are following. I guess we will have to figure out what to do for people who follow more people.

Charge people in Tiers?
